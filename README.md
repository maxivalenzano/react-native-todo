# react-native-todo
Challenge React Native with Expo

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/maxivalenzano/react-native-todo.git` command
2. Switch to the project's root directory in terminal
3. Install the dependencies by running `yarn install`
4. Run `expo start` to start the expo and react-native server
5. If it shows a QR code on the terminal as a result of 'expo start' command, then you are good to go!

#### Mobile setup
1. Install 'Expo' application on your android/iOS device. You can find the links to Android and iOS apps [here](https://expo.dev/tools).
2. Scan the QR code shown on the terminal.
3. Once the QR code is successfully scanned, it will take few seconds to load and render the app.

#### `yarn ios`

Like `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `yarn test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on your tests.
